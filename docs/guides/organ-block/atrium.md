| Capacity         | 320                     |
| Tool             | Wooden Hoes or Pickaxes |
| Blast resistance | 1.5                     |

## Obtaining

### Breaking

An atrium can be mined using any hoe or pickaxe. If mined without a proper tool, it doesn't drop itself.

### Crafting

An atrium can be crafted with 8 [hemoglobium ingots](../misc-items/#hemoglobium-ingot) and 1 chest.

## Usage

### Storage

Atriums are the only blocks capable of taking sanguinity from a player and storing that in their group.

An atrium doesn't take sanguinity from players in Creative mode. Instead, it simply adds the prompted amount into its group.
