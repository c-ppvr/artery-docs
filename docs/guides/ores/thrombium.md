## Obtaining

### Mining

Thrombium ores can be mined with iron pickaxes or better. Breaking thrombium ores drops 1 raw thrombium, unless mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. It is affected by Fortune.

### Smelting

Thrombium ingots can be obtained by smelting thrombium ores, deepslate thrombium ores, or raw thrombium.
