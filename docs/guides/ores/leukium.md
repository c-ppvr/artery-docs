## Obtaining

### Mining

Leukium ores can be mined with iron pickaxes or better. Breaking leukium ores drops 1 raw leukium, unless mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe, in which case it drops itself. It is affected by Fortune.

### Smelting

Leukium ingots can be obtained by smelting leukium ores, deepslate leukium ores, or raw leukium.
