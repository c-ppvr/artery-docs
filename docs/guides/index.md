# Guides

::: info
These pages only document the latest version of Artery (v0.2.1+1.21.4).
:::

This feels more like a wiki than a guide, but by definition this isn't a wiki.

## Installation

Please refer to [Fabric Document](https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/) to learn how to install Fabric, though I recommand using a launcher, such as [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) or [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

Artery can be downloaded from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/artery) or [GitHub](https://github.com/c-ppvr/artery/releases).
