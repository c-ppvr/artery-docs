# Extending Artery

::: warning
I have no idea how this should be done; I just feel obligated to put something here. I don't even have a maven repository.

You can extend `OrganBlock` and `OrganBlockEntity`, maybe. They represent a block with entity that would be added to some `OrganGroup`, which is then saved by `OrganGroupState`.
